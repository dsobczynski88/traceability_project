# *reqtracer* 
**Applying Generative AI, NLP and data science to software quality processes** 

### Inspiration
My inspiration for this project began during a career change into software quality. My goal is to look for ways to improve software development documentation with the broader goal to improve product quality. I hope that others find this work to be useful in their personal or professional experience. 

### Project Description
This project applies NLP and data science tools with the goal to improve software quality artifact reviews -- specifically regarding traceability. This project intends to perform the following functions:

1. Leveraging OpenAI's API to explore prompt engineering techniques to streamline the requirements engineering process
2. Analyze requirement-test case relationships to optimize test case coverage*
3. Analyze test cases for language consistency and redundancy*
4. Enhanced traceability matrix by incorporating design linkages within formal requirements to test case trace matrix*
5. Analyze design to test case relationships to identify potential gaps in test case design*
*Currently in progress

### Technologies used
This project is written in Python. The choice of Python is based on its broad-range support from the data science and AI community.

### Challenges faced and outlook ahead
TBD

### Getting Started
TBD

### Intended Use
This project is intended to be used during the software development process to create or review software artifacts such as those created in a requirements management tool (requirements, test cases, etc.). 

### Credits
Would like to thank all my colleagues I've gotten to work with over these initial 12 months in this software quality role.
