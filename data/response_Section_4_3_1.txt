        "The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application.",
        "The requirement uses correct grammar; however, 'view access capability' could be more clearly defined. For example, specifying the aspects of view access expected (e.g., read, search, filter) would improve clarity."

        "The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.",
        "The requirement uses correct grammar, but similar to the previous statement, 'update access capability' should be better defined. Clarifying the scope of updates allowed (e.g., what data can be updated) would enhance understanding."

        "The Disputes System must allow the users to select disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction) from a user interface and initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction.",
        "The requirement contains complex grammatical structure which could lead to ambiguity, particularly with 'from a user interface'. This should be rephrased for clarity, potentially splitting it into simpler sentences. Additionally, defining 'disputable transactions' and clarifying the user interface's characteristics would improve the requirement."

        "The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.",
        "The requirement is grammatically correct, but 'initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions' may cause confusion regarding whether it's a single case for different transactions or multiple cases for one transaction. Clarifying this distinction is recommended."

        "The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.",
        "This requirement contains grammatical errors, particularly in the phrase 'the ticket retrieval creation process'. The omission of an article ('the' or 'a') before 'ticket retrieval creation process' creates a grammatical flaw. Furthermore, the phrase is overly complex and could be broken down to enhance clarity. It is advisable to define 'required information' specifically to eliminate ambiguity."
