R14 – CORRECT PUNCTUATION 
Definition: 
Use correct punctuation. 
Elaboration: 
Incorrect punctuation can cause confusion between sub-clauses in a need or requirement 
statement.  
A need or requirement statement with incorrect punctuation is not Correct (C8) 
Note also that the more punctuation in a need or requirement statement, the greater the 
opportunity for ambiguity. 
Many word processing applications are capable of applying a set of punctuation rules as text is 
entered based on a set of built-in rules that are selectable.  When using an application specific 
set of punctuation rules, project-specific punctuation items may be flagged as incorrect as they 
may not be applicable to the project’s use of punctuation. Therefore, the application punctuation 
checking can be regarded as a project-specific aspect. Many applications allow the user to “turn 
off” or “ignore” punctuation rules that do not apply to the project. 
 
Examples: 
Unacceptable: The Navigation_Beacon shall provide Augmentation_Data having the 
characteristics defined in <ICD xyz> to each Maritime_User, engaged in 
Harbor_Harbor_Approach_Maneuvering (HHA) at an accuracy of less than 20 meters.   
[This is unacceptable because the incorrectly placed comma in this sentence confuses the 
meaning, leading the reader to believe that the accuracy is related to the maneuver rather than 
to the augmentation data.]  
Improved: The Navigation_Beacon shall provide Navigation_Data having the characteristics 
defined in <ICD xyz> to each Maritime_User engaged in Harbor_Harbor_Approach_Maneuvering 
(HHA), at an accuracy of less than 20 meters. 
[The positioning of the comma now makes it clear that the accuracy and availability relate to the 
data. Also note that, while performance measures are included, the appropriate conditions are 
not addressed.  Further “Navigation_Beacon”, “Navigation_Data”, “Maritime_User”, and 
“Harbor_Harbor_Approach_Maneuvering (HHA)” must be defined in the glossary or data 
dictionary.]
