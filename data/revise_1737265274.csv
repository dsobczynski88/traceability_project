0,The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application.,"The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application, where 'view access' includes the ability to view transaction details, dispute statuses, and any related documents. Authorized users are defined as individuals who have been granted access by the system administrator.","The requirement states that view access is provided for authorized users, but does not specify what ""view access capability"" entails. It could benefit from clarification on what constitutes ""view access"" (e.g., specific data or features that can be viewed) to ensure unambiguous interpretation. The requirement specifies the system functionality ('provide view access capability') but lacks clarity on what 'view access' entails. It would benefit from a more detailed definition of 'view access' to eliminate ambiguity regarding the types of data or transactions users can view. Additionally, it should clarify who qualifies as 'authorized users'.",['1737265274'],revise,,"['The', 'Disputes', 'System', 'shall', 'provide', 'view', 'access', 'capability', 'for', 'authorized', 'users', 'of', 'the', 'application,', 'where', ""'view"", ""access'"", 'includes', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'view', 'transaction', 'details,', 'dispute', 'statuses,', 'and', 'any', 'related', 'documents.', 'Authorized', 'users', 'are', 'defined', 'as', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'granted', 'access', 'by', 'the', 'system', 'administrator.']"
1,The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.,"The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application, which includes modifying existing dispute records, adding new data related to disputes, and changing the status of disputes. Authorized users are defined as individuals who have been granted access by the system administrator.","Similar to the first requirement, this statement lacks specifics regarding what ""update access capability"" entails. Defining what can be updated would help in ensuring that the requirement is clearly understood by all stakeholders, thus reducing ambiguity. Similar to Requirement A, this statement lacks specificity regarding the meaning of 'update access'. It should clarify what 'update' entailsâ€”whether it's modifying existing data, adding new data, or changing the status of disputes. Defining 'authorized users' further would help eliminate potential misinterpretations.",['1737265274'],revise,,"['The', 'Disputes', 'System', 'shall', 'provide', 'update', 'access', 'capability', 'for', 'authorized', 'users', 'of', 'the', 'application,', 'which', 'includes', 'modifying', 'existing', 'dispute', 'records,', 'adding', 'new', 'data', 'related', 'to', 'disputes,', 'and', 'changing', 'the', 'status', 'of', 'disputes.', 'Authorized', 'users', 'are', 'defined', 'as', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'granted', 'access', 'by', 'the', 'system', 'administrator.']"
2,The Disputes System must allow the users to select disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction) from a user interface and initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction.,"The Disputes System must allow users to select disputable transactions based on defined criteria, including a maximum age of 30 days from the transaction date. Users may initiate a dispute by selecting one of the following actions: a ticket retrieval request or a chargeback notification. This requirement will be split into two; one for selecting disputable transactions and another for initiating a dispute.","This requirement is more detailed but could still be ambiguous. The term ""disputable transactions"" is subjective; it should specify what criteria define ""disputable"" transactions to mitigate interpretation issues. Additionally, it is unclear what actions constitute ""initiate a dispute"" and should be explicitly defined. This requirement mixes multiple functionalities into one statement, which could lead to ambiguity. It should be split into two or more distinct requirements: one for selecting disputable transactions and another for initiating disputes. Furthermore, specifying criteria for 'age of the transaction' as well as clarifying the types of disputes would improve verifiability.",['1737265274'],revise,,"['The', 'Disputes', 'System', 'must', 'allow', 'users', 'to', 'select', 'disputable', 'transactions', 'based', 'on', 'defined', 'criteria,', 'including', 'a', 'maximum', 'age', 'of', '30', 'days', 'from', 'the', 'transaction', 'date.', 'Users', 'may', 'initiate', 'a', 'dispute', 'by', 'selecting', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'following', 'actions:', 'a', 'ticket', 'retrieval', 'request', 'or', 'a', 'chargeback', 'notification.', 'This', 'requirement', 'will', 'be', 'split', 'into', 'two;', 'one', 'for', 'selecting', 'disputable', 'transactions', 'and', 'another', 'for', 'initiating', 'a', 'dispute.']"
3,The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.,"The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate one dispute case that may include multiple transactions associated with a single merchant. A 'single merchant' is defined as a merchant with a unique identifier, and the maximum number of transactions within one dispute case shall be specified as no more than 5.","The phrase ""initiate a single dispute case"" could lead to different interpretations. It should clarify if it means that one dispute case can contain multiple transactions or a single request can span multiple cases. Clear examples or definitions may enhance understanding and address ambiguity. The requirement is somewhat clear, but it might lead to ambiguity regarding 'multiple transactions' and 'single merchant'. It needs clarification on what constitutes 'multiple transactions' (e.g. number of transactions) and how the system identifies a 'single merchant'. Elaboration on whether there are limitations on the type or total number of transactions could further improve clarity.",['1737265274'],revise,,"['The', 'Disputes', 'System', 'must', 'provide', 'the', 'user', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'initiate', 'one', 'dispute', 'case', 'that', 'may', 'include', 'multiple', 'transactions', 'associated', 'with', 'a', 'single', 'merchant.', 'A', ""'single"", ""merchant'"", 'is', 'defined', 'as', 'a', 'merchant', 'with', 'a', 'unique', 'identifier,', 'and', 'the', 'maximum', 'number', 'of', 'transactions', 'within', 'one', 'dispute', 'case', 'shall', 'be', 'specified', 'as', 'no', 'more', 'than', '5.']"
4,The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.,"The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create a ticket retrieval request by prompting the user to enter specific required information, which includes transaction ID, user contact information, and transaction date. The ticket retrieval request is a documented inquiry sent to the merchant for validating the transaction in question.","The use of ""create or initiate"" may cause confusion; it should clarify if these actions are synonymous or distinct steps. Additionally, terms like ""all the required information"" should list specific fields or criteria needed. While the latter part defines what a ticket retrieval request is, more detailed steps in the process and clarifications on user prompts would improve clarity and reduce ambiguity. This requirement is somewhat clear regarding the function of creating a ticket retrieval request. However, it could benefit from clearly stating what constitutes 'required information' in the prompt and the exact contents of the ticket retrieval request. The term 'merchant' should also be defined to avoid ambiguity. The final sentence could be further refined to remove compound statements to enhance clarity.",['1737265274'],revise,,"['The', 'Disputes', 'System', 'will', 'provide', 'the', 'user', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'create', 'a', 'ticket', 'retrieval', 'request', 'by', 'prompting', 'the', 'user', 'to', 'enter', 'specific', 'required', 'information,', 'which', 'includes', 'transaction', 'ID,', 'user', 'contact', 'information,', 'and', 'transaction', 'date.', 'The', 'ticket', 'retrieval', 'request', 'is', 'a', 'documented', 'inquiry', 'sent', 'to', 'the', 'merchant', 'for', 'validating', 'the', 'transaction', 'in', 'question.']"
