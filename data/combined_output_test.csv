0,"The term 'view access capability' may be ambiguous. It would benefit from specifying the exact nature of access (e.g., read-only access, access to specific data elements). Additionally, the phrase 'authorized users' should be clearly defined to avoid varied interpretations regarding who qualifies as 'authorized'. The requirement uses correct grammar; however, 'view access capability' could be more clearly defined. For example, specifying the aspects of view access expected (e.g., read, search, filter) would improve clarity. The requirement has correct spelling and capitalization. It uses 'authorized' consistently and does not contain any ambiguous terms. No improvement needed. This requirement uses correct punctuation; however, the sentence structure is somewhat informal. Consider revising for clarity by specifying what ""view access capability"" entails. The requirement is clear and follows a singular thought. However, it lacks logical expressions that could clarify any conditions under which view access is granted. For improvement, it can be rephrased to include conditions, e.g., ""The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users who meet [specific criteria]."" The requirement is clear and straightforward. It uses positive language and does not include the word ""not."" It effectively states what the system shall do, making it verifiable. The use of the term ""access capability"" could introduce ambiguity. It is recommended to specify the exact nature of the access, e.g., ""view only"" or ""view and download.""",The Disputes System shall provide read-only access to specific data elements for authorized users who meet [specific criteria].,"['specific', '[specific', 'criteria].', 'data', 'elements', 'who', 'to', 'meet', 'read-only']"
1,"Similar to Requirement A, the term 'update access capability' lacks clarity. It should specify what constitutes an 'update' and potentially define 'authorized users'. The requirement should eliminate ambiguity about the actions permissible by the authorized users. The requirement uses correct grammar, but similar to the previous statement, 'update access capability' should be better defined. Clarifying the scope of updates allowed (e.g., what data can be updated) would enhance understanding. The requirement has correct spelling and capitalization. It uses 'authorized' consistently and does not contain any ambiguous terms. No improvement needed. This requirement also uses correct punctuation. Similar to the first requirement, consider outlining what ""update access capability"" includes for greater clarity. Similar to Requirement A, this requirement is clear but could benefit from specifying conditions that define ""authorized users."" Logical expressions could clarify the criteria for modification rights, e.g., ""The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users who fulfill [specific conditions]."" This requirement is also clearly defined and uses positive language. There is no use of ""not,"" and the requirement can be verified. Similar to requirement A, ""update access capability"" is ambiguous. It is advised to clarify what kind of updates are permitted, such as ""update transaction status"" or ""modify user information.""",The Disputes System shall provide the ability for authorized users who fulfill [specific conditions] to update transaction status or modify user information.,"['conditions]', 'ability', '[specific', 'transaction', 'information.', 'fulfill', 'user', 'who', 'to', 'modify', 'or', 'status']"
2,"This requirement is somewhat lengthy and complex, which might lead to differing interpretations. The phrase 'disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction)' should define what age qualifies a transaction as disputable. Furthermore, the terms 'ticket retrieval request' and 'chargeback notification' need clarification on what each process entails. The requirement contains complex grammatical structure which could lead to ambiguity, particularly with 'from a user interface'. This should be rephrased for clarity, potentially splitting it into simpler sentences. Additionally, defining 'disputable transactions' and clarifying the user interface's characteristics would improve the requirement. The requirement has correct spelling but is quite complex and lengthy. Consider breaking it into multiple requirements for clarity and to avoid potential ambiguity. Ensure consistent terminology (e.g., 'users' vs. 'the user'). This requirement contains a complex structure with several clauses. The parentheses around ""based on the age of the transaction"" may create ambiguity regarding the relationship between the age of the transaction and the selection of disputable transactions. Consider rephrasing to clarify: e.g., ""The Disputes System must allow users to select disputable transactions from a user interface, where disputable is defined based on the age of the transaction, and initiate a dispute on the selected transaction."" This requirement includes multiple actions combined with ""and,"" which introduces ambiguity regarding the scope of conditions. It should be separated into distinct requirements or use logical expressions. A better formulation would be: ""The Disputes System must allow users to select disputable transactions based on [age criteria] and must allow initiation of a dispute [as a ticket retrieval request OR chargeback notification]."" The requirement is well-formulated and uses affirmative language. It does not include the word ""not,"" which aids in its verifiability. However, it could benefit from splitting into two distinct requirements: one for selecting transactions and another for initiating a dispute to enhance clarity. The term ""(ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification)"" employs an oblique symbol. It is recommended to specify these as two distinct requirements or clarify the conditions under which both actions can occur instead of using ""or.""","The Disputes System must allow users to select disputable transactions based on [age criteria] from a user interface. Additionally, the system must allow users to initiate a dispute as either a ticket retrieval request or a chargeback notification for the selected transactions.","['criteria]', 'notification', 'transactions.', 'system', 'interface.', 'as', '[age', 'based', 'Additionally,', 'ticket', 'either', 'for']"
3,"The requirement is somewhat clear but can benefit from defining what 'multiple transactions' entails, and what constitutes a 'single dispute case'. Additionally, it can clarify the limitations or conditions under which transactions from a single merchant can be grouped. The requirement is grammatically correct, but 'initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions' may cause confusion regarding whether it's a single case for different transactions or multiple cases for one transaction. Clarifying this distinction is recommended. The requirement has correct spelling and capitalization. However, it could be improved for clarity by specifying what constitutes 'belonging' to a single merchant. Consider revising to eliminate any ambiguity regarding 'single dispute case'. This requirement uses correct punctuation; however, the term ""the user"" could be made more specific (e.g., ""an authorized user"") to improve clarity. Additionally, consider breaking this complex requirement into simpler components. Example: ""The Disputes System must allow an authorized user to initiate a single dispute case. This case may involve multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant."" This requirement is straightforward but could improve clarity by explicitly defining what constitutes a ""single dispute case"" and ""multiple transactions."" Introducing logical expressions may also enhance it, e.g., ""The Disputes System must allow the user to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions belonging to [a single merchant, provided the transactions meet certain criteria]."" This requirement is clear and uses positive language without including ""not"". However, more specificity could improve it, such as defining the criteria for what constitutes a ""single dispute case."" This requirement is clear and does not use the oblique symbol, thus meeting the guideline. No improvements are necessary.","The Disputes System must allow an authorized user to initiate a single dispute case involving multiple transactions that are grouped under a single merchant, provided the transactions meet certain criteria.","['grouped', 'certain', 'an', 'criteria.', 'are', 'under', 'provided', 'involving', 'allow', 'merchant,', 'meet', 'authorized']"
