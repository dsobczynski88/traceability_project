As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request.  The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.', 
        'The first part of this requirement uses affirmative language without "not," which is good. However, it is lengthy and could be broken into more concise statements for readability. The second sentence contains a lot of information that could be clarified and split into requirements focusing on the prompt for user input and the definition of a ticket retrieval request.'
