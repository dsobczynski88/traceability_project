    ['The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application.', 'This requirement uses correct punctuation; however, the sentence structure is somewhat informal. Consider revising for clarity by specifying what "view access capability" entails.'],
    ['The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.', 'This requirement also uses correct punctuation. Similar to the first requirement, consider outlining what "update access capability" includes for greater clarity.'],
    ['The Disputes System must allow the users to select disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction) from a user interface and initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction.', 'This requirement contains a complex structure with several clauses. The parentheses around "based on the age of the transaction" may create ambiguity regarding the relationship between the age of the transaction and the selection of disputable transactions. Consider rephrasing to clarify: e.g., "The Disputes System must allow users to select disputable transactions from a user interface, where disputable is defined based on the age of the transaction, and initiate a dispute on the selected transaction."'],
    ['The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.', 'This requirement uses correct punctuation; however, the term "the user" could be made more specific (e.g., "an authorized user") to improve clarity. Additionally, consider breaking this complex requirement into simpler components. Example: "The Disputes System must allow an authorized user to initiate a single dispute case. This case may involve multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant."'],
    ['The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.', 'This requirement has punctuation errors, particularly a missing comma after "process" in the second sentence. Consider revising to: "As part of the ticket retrieval creation process, the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information." Additionally, using "will" suggests a future intention; change to "shall" or "must" for a stronger requirement. The sentence structure could be simplified for clarity: "The ticket retrieval request, sent to the merchant, inquires about the validity of a transaction."']
