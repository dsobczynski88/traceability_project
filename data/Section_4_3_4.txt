R15 – LOGICAL EXPRESSIONS 
Definition: 
Use a defined convention to express logical expressions such as “[X AND Y]”, “[X OR Y]”,  
[X XOR Y]”, “NOT [X OR Y]”. 
Elaboration: 
As with the other rules and characteristics, we want to keep requirement statements as one 
thought with singular statements.  Thus, we avoid using “and” when it involves tying two thoughts 
together.  However, it is acceptable to use “AND”, “OR”, “XOR”, and “NOT” in a logical sense 
when talking about conditions to which the verb applies.  All logical expressions decompose to 
either “true” or “false”, resulting in a singular statement. 
Examples of conventions: 
1. Place conjunctions in italics or in all capitals (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) to indicate that the 
author intends the conjunction to play a role in a condition. 
2. Place conditions within square brackets, also using the brackets to control their scope. 
For example, “[X AND Y].” 
Further, use of “and/or” is non-specific and therefore ambiguous.  The most common 
interpretation of the expression “and/or” is as an inclusive OR: either X OR Y OR both.   
• If an inclusive OR is intended, that should be written as “at least one of <the two or more 
requirements>”.   
• If an Exclusive OR is intended, that should be written as “Either <Requirement 1> OR 
<Requirement 2> but NOT both”, and similar wording. 
Note that caution should be used when including logical expressions in requirement statements.  
In many cases the use of logical expressions is more appropriate to design output 
specifications/requirements.  Design Input Requirements should focus on why the logical actions 
are needed - prevent something bad from happening, for example,  
The use of logical expressions within requirement statements is appropriate when stating “under 
what conditions” apply to a need or requirement.  For example, an action that must take place 
based on whether at logical condition is true or false.

Examples: 
Unacceptable: The Engine_Management_System shall disengage the 
Speed_Control_Subsystem within <TBD seconds> when the Cruise_Control is engaged, and the 
Driver applies the Accelerator.   
[This is unacceptable because of the ambiguity of “and” could be confused with combining two 
separate thoughts.  Instead use the form of a logical expression [X AND Y].] 
Improved: When [the Cruise_Control is Engaged] AND [the Accelerator is Applied], the 
Engine_Management_System shall Disengage the Speed_Control_Subsystem within <TBD 
seconds>.  
[“Engine_Management_System”, “Speed_Control_Subsystem”, “Disengage”, “Engaged”, 
“Accelerator”, “Applied”, and “Cruise_Control” must be defined in the glossary or data dictionary.]

Exceptions and relationships: 
While R21: Avoid Parentheses states that parentheses or brackets are to be avoided within 
general sentence structure, this rule suggests that brackets may be used as part of a convention to 
avoid ambiguity when expressing a logical expression.
