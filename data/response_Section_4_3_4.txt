    ['The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application.', 'The requirement is clear but does not utilize any logical expression; since it is a singular thought, it does not require improvement. No ambiguity is present.'],
    ['The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.', 'Similar to Requirement A, this requirement is clear and singular. It does not incorporate logical expressions and does not need improvement as it does not present ambiguity.'],
    ['The Disputes System must allow the users to select disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction) from a user interface and initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction.', 'This requirement contains multiple thoughts connected by "and", which creates ambiguity. It could be improved by breaking it into two separate requirements or restructuring it to use logical expressions, for example, "The Disputes System must allow users to [select disputable transactions based on the age of the transaction] AND [initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction]".'],
    ['The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.', 'This requirement is singular and effectively communicates a clear need without the use of logical expressions. It does not require changes as it does not introduce ambiguity.'],
    ['The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.', 'This requirement contains multiple clauses and lacks clear logical expressions, leading to potential confusion. It is advisable to separate the different aspects into individual requirements or utilize logical expressions for clarity. For example, "The Disputes System must allow the user to [create or initiate a ticket retrieval request] AND the system must [prompt the user to enter all required information]".']
