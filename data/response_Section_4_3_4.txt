    ['The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application.', 
     'The requirement is clear and follows a singular thought. However, it lacks logical expressions that could clarify any conditions under which view access is granted. For improvement, it can be rephrased to include conditions, e.g., "The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users who meet [specific criteria]."'],
    
    ['The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.', 
     'Similar to Requirement A, this requirement is clear but could benefit from specifying conditions that define "authorized users." Logical expressions could clarify the criteria for modification rights, e.g., "The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users who fulfill [specific conditions]."'],
    
    ['The Disputes System must allow the users to select disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction) from a user interface and initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction.', 
     'This requirement includes multiple actions combined with "and," which introduces ambiguity regarding the scope of conditions. It should be separated into distinct requirements or use logical expressions. A better formulation would be: "The Disputes System must allow users to select disputable transactions based on [age criteria] and must allow initiation of a dispute [as a ticket retrieval request OR chargeback notification]."'],
    
    ['The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.', 
     'This requirement is straightforward but could improve clarity by explicitly defining what constitutes a "single dispute case" and "multiple transactions." Introducing logical expressions may also enhance it, e.g., "The Disputes System must allow the user to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions belonging to [a single merchant, provided the transactions meet certain criteria]."'],
    
    ['The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.', 
     'This requirement is overly verbose and includes multiple statements without clear logical expression structure. It should be broken down for clarity and to fulfill the singular thought requirement. Additionally, it could incorporate logical expressions, e.g., "The Disputes System shall provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request, where the system must prompt the user to enter all required information [prior to generating the request to the merchant]."']
