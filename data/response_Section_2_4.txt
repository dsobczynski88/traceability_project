        'Program Administrators and Nursing Staff Members shall be able to specify the preferred sequence of classes for a given cohort.',
        'The requirement includes the roles "Program Administrators" and "Nursing Staff Members", but does not specify what "preferred sequence of classes" means. It lacks clarity on how this preference is established or prioritized, leading to possible multiple interpretations of what these roles can specify. Recommendations include defining what constitutes a "preferred sequence" and how it will be determined to remove ambiguity.'

        'The product shall allow a user to identify himself or herself as a player.',
        'The phrase "identify himself or herself" is ambiguous as it does not clarify the method of identification. This could include username, email, or another identifier. Consider rephrasing to specify the identification method (e.g., "the product shall allow a user to enter a username or email to identify as a player") to enhance clarity and reduce ambiguity.'

        'The term "view access capability" is not well-defined. It is unclear what constitutes "view access" (e.g., permissions for viewing documents, records, etc.). Recommend detailing what specific content is accessible and what "authorized users" entail to ensure a singular interpretation.'

        'The phrase "either by credit card or mail-in payment option" is slightly ambiguous as it does not specify if both options are available concurrently or if they are mutually exclusive. This could lead to confusion. It is advisable to clarify whether customers can use both payment methods or choose one to enhance understanding.'
