        "The term 'view access capability' may be ambiguous. It would benefit from specifying the exact nature of access (e.g., read-only access, access to specific data elements). Additionally, the phrase 'authorized users' should be clearly defined to avoid varied interpretations regarding who qualifies as 'authorized'."
    ],
    [
        "The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.",
        "Similar to Requirement A, the term 'update access capability' lacks clarity. It should specify what constitutes an 'update' and potentially define 'authorized users'. The requirement should eliminate ambiguity about the actions permissible by the authorized users."

        "The Disputes System must allow the users to select disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction) from a user interface and initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction.",
        "This requirement is somewhat lengthy and complex, which might lead to differing interpretations. The phrase 'disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction)' should define what age qualifies a transaction as disputable. Furthermore, the terms 'ticket retrieval request' and 'chargeback notification' need clarification on what each process entails."

        "The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.",
        "The requirement is somewhat clear but can benefit from defining what 'multiple transactions' entails, and what constitutes a 'single dispute case'. Additionally, it can clarify the limitations or conditions under which transactions from a single merchant can be grouped."

        "The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.",
        "This requirement is overly verbose, making it prone to misinterpretation. It should be broken down into simpler, clearer statements. The phrase 'all the required information' is ambiguous and should specify what information is required. The final sentence may also imply subjective interpretations about the 'validity of a transaction', which should be defined more explicitly."
