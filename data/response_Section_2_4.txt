    ['The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application.', 
     'The requirement is somewhat ambiguous regarding what constitutes "view access capability." It should specify the types of data or sections of the application that authorized users can view to eliminate any assumptions about the extent of access.'],
    
    ['The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.', 
     'Similar to the previous requirement, the term "update access capability" is vague. The requirement should clearly define what types of updates users are permitted to make, e.g., updates to user profiles, dispute details, etc.'],
    
    ['The Disputes System must allow the users to select disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction) from a user interface and initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction.', 
     'This requirement is complex and may be interpreted in multiple ways, particularly regarding "disputable transactions" and the mechanics of initiating a dispute. It should clarify the criteria for disputable transactions and detail the steps for initiating a dispute to avoid confusion on the necessary actions and features of the user interface.'],
    
    ['The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.', 
     'The phrase "multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant" could be misconstrued. Clarifying whether it refers to transactions grouped specifically by the merchantâ€™s ID or other criteria would help eliminate ambiguity. A more precise definition would lead to clearer understanding and implementation.'],
    
    ['The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.', 
     'This requirement contains valuable information but could benefit from being more concise and explicit. The term "all the required information" is vague and should specify what information is required (e.g., transaction ID, merchant ID). Furthermore, defining the expected format for the ticket retrieval request could also enhance understanding and reduce ambiguity.']
