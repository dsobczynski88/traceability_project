    ['The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application.', 'The requirement is acceptable as it does not use the oblique symbol. However, it could be improved by explicitly defining what constitutes "view access capability" to prevent ambiguity.'],
    ['The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.', 'Similar to the previous requirement, this one does not contain the oblique symbol. However, clarification on what "update access capability" includes would enhance precision.'],
    ['The Disputes System must allow the users to select disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction) from a user interface and initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction.', 'This requirement includes the oblique symbol in "ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification," leading to ambiguity about what actions users can take. It would be beneficial to split this requirement into two separate ones to clarify user actions: one for initiating a ticket retrieval request and another for chargeback notification.'],
    ['The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.', 'The requirement is clear and does not include the oblique symbol. However, it could be made more precise by defining what "multiple transactions" entails.'],
    ['The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.', 'The requirement contains the oblique symbol in "create or initiate," which can lead to ambiguity. This should be clarified by using separate requirements for "create" and "initiate." Additionally, the explanation about prompting for required information could be more concise to enhance clarity.']
