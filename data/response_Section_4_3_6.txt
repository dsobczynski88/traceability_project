    ['The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application.', 
     'The use of the term "access capability" could introduce ambiguity. It is recommended to specify the exact nature of the access, e.g., "view only" or "view and download."'],
    
    ['The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.', 
     'Similar to requirement A, "update access capability" is ambiguous. It is advised to clarify what kind of updates are permitted, such as "update transaction status" or "modify user information."'],
    
    ['The Disputes System must allow the users to select disputable transactions (based on the age of the transaction) from a user interface and initiate a dispute (ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification) on the selected transaction.', 
     'The term "(ticket retrieval request or chargeback notification)" employs an oblique symbol. It is recommended to specify these as two distinct requirements or clarify the conditions under which both actions can occur instead of using "or."'],
    
    ['The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.', 
     'This requirement is clear and does not use the oblique symbol, thus meeting the guideline. No improvements are necessary.'],
    
    ['The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.', 
     'The phrase "create or initiate a ticket retrieval request" uses an oblique symbol. It is suggested to clarify the requirement by specifying either creation or initiation, or rephrase it to maintain clarity across distinct actions. Additional details on the required information could also help enhance this requirement.']
