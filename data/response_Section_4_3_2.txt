        "The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users of the application.",
        "The requirement is acceptable in spelling and capitalization; however, it could be improved by specifying what 'view access capability' entails. Defining 'authorized users' and providing clarity on what access details fall under 'view' would further enhance verifiability."

        "The Disputes System shall provide update access capability for authorized users of the application.",
        "Similar to Requirement A, this requirement is free from spelling errors. It would benefit from clarification on what 'update access capability' includes and how 'authorized users' are defined for better validation."

        "The spelling is correct, but the phrase 'disputable transactions' could be specified better. The meaning of 'age of the transaction' should be clarified. Additionally, consider defining 'user interface' to ensure all stakeholders have a common understanding."

        "The Disputes System must provide the user the ability to initiate a single dispute case on multiple transactions that belong to a single merchant.",
        "The spelling and capitalization are correct. However, the term 'single merchant' should be defined to clarify what conditions qualify a merchant as 'single'. Furthermore, additional context on how the 'dispute case' operates can improve understanding."

        "The Disputes System will provide the user the ability to create or initiate a ticket retrieval request. As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.",
        "Spelling is accurate but the phrasing is somewhat repetitive. The term 'ticket retrieval request' is used multiple times, which may create confusion. It would be beneficial to consolidate the information and clearly define what constitutes 'all the required information'. Also, 'merchant' should likely be specified as 'the merchant' for clarity."
