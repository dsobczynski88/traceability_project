As part of ticket retrieval creation process the system must prompt the user to enter all the required information to create the ticket retrieval request. The ticket retrieval request is a document that is sent to merchant inquiring the validity of a transaction.,"The requirement is verbose and could be simplified. The phrase 'create or initiate a ticket retrieval request' introduces ambiguity; it should specify if both actions are necessary or if one suffices. Furthermore, detailing what 'all the required information' entails would strengthen the requirement's clarity and ensure it is verifiable.","While this requirement provides more context, terms like 'all the required information' remain vaguely defined. Listing the required information explicitly and clarifying what constitutes 'ticket retrieval request' would improve understanding. Furthermore, there may be inconsistencies with verb usage ('will' vs. 'must') that should be standardized.","The requirement is verbose and could be simplified.

An \nagreement is difficult to enact unless both parties are clear on the exact obligation.   \nAs shown in Figure 11, the intent of a need or requirement must be understood, in the same way, \nby all intended audiences across the lifecycle.  \n  \nFigure 11: Needs and Requirements Understood in the Same Way \nAmbiguity leads to interpretations of a need or requirement not intended by the author leading to \nproblems such schedule slips, budget overruns, or a failure of the SOI to pass system validation \nand not be accepted for its intended use; which could result in litigation and financial loss. \nAn ambiguous need or requirement is neither Correct (C8) nor Verifiable/Validatable (C7).   \n \nGuidance: \nWhen writing a need or requirement statement, ask whether it could be interpreted more than one \nway.  It is common for people to interpret words based on their own set of filters, biases, and \nassumptions.  For example, if a person states: I need a cream for wrinkles. - what was the \nintended meaning of the word for  to give, remove, or prevent?   If someone goes to a \nbarber and states: I need my hair shorter  I want it over my ears.  what was the intended \nmeaning of the word over - cover or above? \nOften, people will use common words by themselves without using a modifier that helps the \nreceiver understand the context, and thus the intended meaning of the word used.
