          <span style="font-size:12px">The term 'view access capability' may be ambiguous. It would benefit from specifying the exact nature of access (e.g., read-only access, access to specific data elements). Additionally, the phrase 'authorized users' should be clearly defined to avoid varied interpretations regarding who qualifies as 'authorized'. The requirement uses correct grammar; however, 'view access capability' could be more clearly defined. For example, specifying the aspects of view access expected (e.g., read, search, filter) would improve clarity. The requirement has correct spelling and capitalization. It uses 'authorized' consistently and does not contain any ambiguous terms. No improvement needed. This requirement uses correct punctuation; however, the sentence structure is somewhat informal. Consider revising for clarity by specifying what "view access capability" entails. The requirement is clear and follows a singular thought. However, it lacks logical expressions that could clarify any conditions under which view access is granted. For improvement, it can be rephrased to include conditions, e.g., "The Disputes System shall provide view access capability for authorized users who meet [specific criteria]." The requirement is clear and straightforward. It uses positive language and does not include the word "not." It effectively states what the system shall do, making it verifiable. The use of the term "access capability" could introduce ambiguity. It is recommended to specify the exact nature of the access, e.g., "view only" or "view and download."</span>
