R16 – USE OF “NOT” 
Definition: 
Avoid the use of the word “not”. 
Elaboration: 
The presence of the word “not” in a need statement or requirement statement implies “not ever”, 
which is impossible to verify in a finite time, in which case, the need statement or requirement 
statement is not correct (C8). 
In theory, there is a large number of actions the system should not do.  Such statements should be 
re-written in the positive—that is, referring to what the entity is to do, rather than what it is not to do. 
Rewriting the need statement or requirement statement to avoid the use of “not” results in a need or 
statement requirement statement that is clearer and is verifiable/validatable (C7). 
 
Examples: 
Unacceptable: The <SOI> shall not fail.   
[This is unacceptable because verification of the requirement would require infinite time. The 
requirement is also infeasible in that, as written, the implication is to never fail, under any 
conditions.] 
Improved:  
The <SOI> shall have an Availability of greater than or equal to 95%.  or  
The <SOI> shall have a Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of xx operating hours. 
[For quality requirements, it would be more precise in the above were written as need 
statements.  Then those transforming the quality need statements into requirement statements 
would define feasible concepts that would result in the needed quality attributes and derive well
formed requirements on the <SOI> that would result in those needs to be met.] 
Unacceptable: The <SOI> shall not contain mercury.   
[This is unacceptable because verification of the requirement would require the ability to 
measure the amount of mercury with infinite accuracy and precision.  In addition, the real 
requirement may not be stated, for example, the real concern may be the use of toxic materials, 
not just mercury.  If that is the case, it may be best to reference a standard from a governmental 
agency concerning allowable exposures to a list of common toxic materials.] 
Improved: The <SOI> shall limit metallic mercury exposure to those coming in contact with the 
<SOI> to less than or equal 0.025 mg/m3 over a period of 8 hours. 
 
Exceptions and relationships: 
It may be reasonable to include “not” in a requirement when the logical “NOT” is implied—for 
example when using not [X or Y].  In that case, however, in accordance with R15, it may be better 
to capitalize the “NOT” to make the logical condition explicit: NOT [X or Y].

There may be other cases such as “The <SOI> shall not be red in color.”, which is stating a 
constraint and is verifiable, as long as the range of shades of red is stated (RBG rr,bb,gg range or 
a “name” of red in some standard).   
The key consideration is verification.  If the “not” can be unambiguously verified, then its use is 
acceptable.
