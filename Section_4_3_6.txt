R17 – USE OF OBLIQUE SYMBOL 
Definition: 
Avoid the use of the oblique (“/”) symbol. 
Elaboration: 
The oblique symbol (“/”), or “slash”, has so many possible meanings that it should be avoided.   
The slash symbol (such as in “user/operator”, “budget/schedule” or the construct “and/or” 
(discussed in R15) can lead to ambiguous statements that do not reflect accurately the true 
stakeholder needs or lifecycle concepts from which the needs in the Integrated Set of Needs 
were derived.   Also see R19. 
 
Exceptions and relationships: 
Exceptions to this rule include where the oblique symbol is used in units (for example “km/h”) or 
when communicating a symmetrical range of a value (for example +/- 5 degrees F).  
The oblique symbol may also be used when expressing ratios or fractions (such as 1/16)—see 
R40. 
 
Examples: 
Unacceptable: The User_Management_System shall Open/Close the User_Account in less than 
1 second.   
[This is unacceptable because it is unclear as to what is meant by open/close: open, close, or 
both?] 
Improved: (Split into two requirements with an appropriate condition)  
When <condition>, the User_Management_System shall Open the User_Account in less than 1 
second. 
When <condition>, the User_Management_System shall Close the User_Account in less than 1 
second.  
Unacceptable: When the Clutch is Disengaged and/or the Brake is Applied, the 
Engine_Management_System shall disengage the Speed_Control_Subsystem within <XYZ ms>.   
[This is unacceptable because of the use of “and/or.” If simultaneity is intended—that is the dual 
conditions must be met at the same time—write the requirements as a logical AND. If “and” is 
meant in the sense that the action is to be completed under each of the conditions, split the two 
thoughts into separate requirements, one for each condition.  If “or” is meant, write the 
requirement as a logical OR.] 
Improved: (As one requirement if simultaneity is intended): 
When [the Clutch is Disengaged] AND [the Brake is Applied], the Engine_Management_System 
shall disengage the Speed_Control_Subsystem within <XYZ ms>.

Improved: (As two requirements if two separate conditions are intended): 
When the Clutch is Disengaged, the Engine_Management_System shall disengage the 
Speed_Control_Subsystem within <XYZ ms>. 
When the Brake is Applied, the Engine_Management_System shall disengage the 
Speed_Control_Subsystem within <XYZ ms>. 
Improved: (As one requirement if inclusive OR is intended)  
When EITHER [the Clutch is Disengaged] OR [the Brake is Applied], the 
Engine_Management_System shall disengage the Speed_Control_Subsystem.
