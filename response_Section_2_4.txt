        "The system should be really secure", 
        "This requirement is ambiguous due to the term 'really secure', which does not specify the level of security required or the criteria by which security will be assessed. Improving this requirement could involve defining measurable security standards or metrics, such as compliance with specific security frameworks or standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST). Clearly specifying security protocols, user access levels, and data protection measures would enhance its verifiability and clarity."

        "The system should be extremely easy to use", 
        "The phrase 'extremely easy to use' is subjective and lacks clarity, making it open to multiple interpretations. To improve this requirement, it should be rephrased to include specific usability criteria, such as completion time for typical tasks, number of steps required to complete an action, or a targeted usability score based on established usability testing metrics (e.g., System Usability Scale). This would ensure all stakeholders have a unified understanding of what constitutes 'easy to use'."
